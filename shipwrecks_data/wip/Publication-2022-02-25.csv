After a such a long hiatus since the last report, moving forward, the hope is to maintain a regular publication schedule detailing the nature and scope of the Associationâ€™s activities.",/publications/MAAWAreports2019-2020volume6.pdf

6,Maritime Archaeological Association of WA Five Year Report: January 1979 to December 1983,8,2,,1983-12-31,"11,15",1,"To review the past five years we have certainly had good and bad yearsfor getting projects done.One only has to refer to the index to notethat only a couple of projects occured in 1980, yet busy times beforeand after.Amateur bodies of any kind seem to suffer from these highand lows of enthusiasm. On the positive side I feel that with a strongactive committee and a general acceptance that MAAWA must publish morereports, a healthy future is assured.Our new newsletter being published by Ronnie Hansen is generatingconsiderable interest, especially amongst members who cannot get toall meetings.The newsletter also encourages members to publish progressnotes rather than face the pressure of completing final project reports,sometimes an awe inspiring task at the completion of field work.Whenever possible, MAAWA should continue to initiate projects independentlyof the WA Museum, but with the same cooperation that has occured over the pastnine years that we have been working together.",/publications/2.FiveYearReport1979-1983.pdf
