We understand that all on board had barely sufficient time to reach the boats before she went down.",The wreck site is located on Murray Reef approx. 1k from the Sisters Reef and 200m north-east of the Highland Forest wreck site.,"The wreckage lies at a depth of 7 to 8m and is spread over an area of 25 by 8m, on a sand bottom with reef surrounding it. The iron structure is well concreted and there is no loose surface material to be seen. The bow of the vessel lies along a mound in the centre of the site indicating the keelson. Previous surveys of the site have recorded bolts, pump sections, sheathing timbers and iron knees. Other remains include a single, 2m long, iron- stocked Admiralty pattern anchor, a windlass barrel, sheathing and lead piping. The location of the iron knees possibly indicate a poop-deck. Pump sections and a deck winch barrel can also be observed in the stern end of the wreck site. (Kenderdine, 1994d:6).",PC,-32.3931,115.6797,,,,

Sievwright,441 tons length 46.9m beam 8.6m draft 4.6m,"In July 1878, when James Service departed Penang, ten passengers, all members of a theatrical group bound for Melbourne, and a crew of ten including the captain, were aboard. The cargo consisted of 3 000 cases of castor oil, 1000 bales of sack bags and 600 bales of jute. The vessel headed southward from Penang to round Cape Leeuwin, a course that should have taken it several hundred miles off the Western Australian coast. As there were no survivors of the wrecking which occurred on the 23rd July 1878, the events that led to James Service being broken in two on the Murray Reef can only be surmised from circumstantial evidence.","Five Fathom Bank, Murray River Area","The wreckage from the James Service lies in 3–4 m of water and is scattered over an area approximately 55 m long by 12 m wide, with the main axis of the keel running about east-west, with the bow pointing west. While much of the plating has disappeared many of the frames are still clearly visible. The bow, canted to starboard, has collapsed but the bowsprit is still in place. The stern, which is in better condition, lies on a sandy bottom in 10 m of water, and rises to within 3 m of the surface. Part of the steering gear is visible, as are some of the masts, a winch and various ship’s fittings.",PC,-32.458,115.664166667,,,,

At 1.00 pm the anchors began to drag, the at the same time the forward mooring lines parted. The vessel, which had been bow on to the sea, swung round and drifted towards the Rockingham Railway and Timber Company’s jetty. Attempts were made to get the August Tellefsen away from the jetty. However this was unsuccessful, and at about 4.00 pm the Barque smashed through the jetty. It came to rest straddling the remains with its keel broken, a hole in the side of the hull and damage to the stern. No lives were lost.",Old small Rockingham Jetty,The jetty was rebuilt over the stricken ship to allow other ships to load. It probably deteriorated where it was. It is believed that parts of the keel still remain at the end of the old small Rockingham jetty.,PC,-32.274458,115.727302,,,,

The vessel struck rocks after parting its anchor warp, and sank on 23July 1841. One of the passengers, Henry de Burgh, left a comprehensive diary	covering the voyage to Australia and his later experiences on the land. Much of the cargo belonged to de Burgh, who had been involved in the organization of the enterprise in England and had an interest in the vessel.","100m from shore near Woodmans Point, Cockburn Sound","The wreck lies in 2-3m of water, 100m from shore. The site was excavated by WA Museum over the course of the mid-1970s. After each field season the site was backfilled with surrounding sediment, and remained buried until the late 1990s, when researchers noted exposed timbers from the shipwreck were heavily degraded. In 2013 a large project saw 36 road crash barriers deployed on-site in a semi-elliptical arrangement and the site recovered with sand. This site is not only historically and archaeologically significant for Western Australians, but to date, remains one of the world’s best-preserved examples of a nineteenth-century illegal slaving ship.",PC,-32.13193,115.743822,,,,

On 19 October 1876, the captain estimated the position of the vessel as 55 kilometres off Cape Bouvard. With the wind behind the vessel and full sails set, Hero of the Nile steered a course north-east towards the Rottnest Lighthouse. The currents took the vessel onto the inside of Murray Reef. And struck Long Point, The vessel grounded heavily on the reef all night and eventually filled with water after the pumps became choked with the sand ballast. All aboard made it safely to shore in the ships boat. The ship was involved in the international trade of guano from northern Australia. At the time this trade was mostly illegal.","The wreck site lies about 300 metres north-east of Long Point, Warnbro Sound","The wreck site has two rows of heavily overgrown out cropping which, upon inspection in 1974, proved to be iron. Fanning revealed timber in good condition under the sand. No shards of pottery nor glassware were evident. The majority of the hull structure does not appear to be broken up and probably lies buried in the sand. Contemporary salvage work on the site probably means there are few ship’s fittings or the remains of cargo to be found. Finders: Mr Broz, H.

After Chalmers struck a second time it got clear again into about 2.5 to 3 fathoms of water, but later struck fast on a sand bottom.
